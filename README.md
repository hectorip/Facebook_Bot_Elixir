# Facebook_Bot_Elixir

Creating a Facebook bot in Elixir, it appears to be only a Web Server with the right
keys and that knows how to answer to certain requests.

This is created using:

 - Plug
 - Poison
 - HTTPoison
 - Cowboy

 The only function is to send a response with button template.

 And deployed in Heroku.
